# IN5320 - Group 6

For our project, we have chosen to implement additional requirements 1, 2, 4, and 6. These were implemented with the aim to create an efficient and user-friendly system, aligning with our project goals.

## Functionality & implementation

#### Inventory - 2, 4

The inventory page displays an overview of commodities and their quantity with the possibility to sort and search, while allowing for the dispensation of commodities. The user is provided with alerts and warnings about stock predictions when trying to dispense, and includes features to manage the commodity recipients.

#### History

The history page provides a visual overview of commodities that have been dispensed or refilled, with capabilities for searching, filtering, and sorting on the displayed table. It includes type (replenish or dispense), date and time, commodity, quantity and recipient.

#### Replenish - 1

The replenish page gives the possibility to efficiently update the stock balance when dozens of different commodities are received at the medical store. You can replenish multiple commodities at once, and get an overview of current stock.

#### Training mode - 6

The training page includes training modules to provide a clear and good introduction to the functionalities of the system. The “Training mode” switch works as a simulation of the main workflows of the application. Once the switch is turned on, no changes to the system in this mode will be stored permanently so the user can test the system as it is.

#### Overall missing functionality and things that do not work optimally

After conducting reviews of the primary workflows with the group and extensive user testing of the application, we have confirmed that almost all functionalities are performing as expected, with no unusual performance issues identified.

Something specific that we noticed was that there were some issues with the search field. If you go to, for example, on page 6 and try to type in something with the letter 'f,' we encounter an error.
